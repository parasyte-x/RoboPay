# RoboPay

Fabric RoboPay connects robots, simulators, cameras, drones, and other physical devices to the Fabric network. It provides a secure paid-action runtime that receives remote action requests, verifies payment through the robot-side tunnel flow, and routes approved actions to connected machines.

## Overview

Fabric introduces a payment layer for machines. RoboPay is the execution component of this stack, exposing machine capabilities as paid endpoints.

A core design principle is that **payment, routing, and execution are separated**. The Fabric backend/proxy receives a paid action request and routes it to the correct robot tunnel by `robotId`. It does not directly verify x402 payment in the production tunnel flow.

The robot-side `tunnel` receives the action request, runs x402 middleware, verifies or rejects the payment, and only publishes a verified action to the robot execution layer after successful verification. The robot controller still owns final safety — **a verified payment is not permission to move unconditionally**.

```

The simulator itself is **not** vendored here. Isaac Sim scenes and policies live in the [OM1-sim](https://github.com/OpenMind/OM1-sim) repo.


## 1. Start the simulator (Isaac Sim / OM1-sim)

The simulator lives in a separate repo, [OpenMind/OM1-sim](https://github.com/OpenMind/OM1-sim). It requires Ubuntu 22.04, ROS2 Humble, an NVIDIA GPU, and Isaac Sim 5.1.0+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenMind/OM1-sim.git
cd OM1-sim

export ISAACSIM_ROOT=/path/to/isaacsim
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
cd isaac_sim && "$ISAACSIM_ROOT/python.sh" run.py --robot_type g1
```

The sim subscribes to ROS2 `/cmd_vel` and drives the robot policy from it.

## 2. Start the bridge

The bridge is a ROS2 workspace under `bridge/`. It needs ROS2 Humble and a Python environment with `eclipse-zenoh`, managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install eclipse-zenoh

make bridge-build
make bridge-run                 # defaults to G1; ROBOT=go2 or ROBOT=tron1 to switch
```

Package names are `isaac_sim_bridge_g1`, `isaac_sim_bridge_go2`, and `isaac_sim_bridge_tron1` (G1 is validated; Go2 and Tron1 are placeholders). The adapter subscribes to the Zenoh topic `robot/tunnel/action` and republishes mapped velocities on ROS2 `/cmd_vel`.

## 3. Start the tunnel

The tunnel (`tunnel/`) keeps an outbound WebSocket to the Fabric proxy, verifies x402 micropayments, and publishes accepted actions to the same Zenoh topic the bridge listens on.

Set the payee address (and any overrides) in `tunnel/config.json`:

```json
{
  "robot_id": "my-robot",
  "evm_payee_address": "0xYourAddress",
  "price": "$0.002",
  "network": "eip155:84532"
}
```

Build and run from the repo root (the `Makefile` operates inside `tunnel/`):

```bash
make build
make run
make test
```

Common environment overrides:

| Variable          | Default                                          | Description                       |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `PROXY_WS_URL`    | `wss://api.fabric.foundation/api/core/ws/robot`  | WebSocket URL of the tunnel proxy |
| `FACILITATOR_URL` | `https://x402.org/facilitator`                   | x402 payment facilitator endpoint |
| `GIN_MODE`        | `release`                                        | `debug` for verbose HTTP logs     |

## 4. Register the robot on BitAgent (Unibase AIP) — optional

With `AIP_ENABLED=true`, the tunnel additionally registers the robot as an
A2A-compatible agent on the BitAgent network (Unibase AIP), so any AIP client
or agent can discover and call it. The integration is built on the
[Unibase AIP Go SDK](https://github.com/unibaseio/aip-go-sdk) — see
`tunnel/internal/aipagent/agent.go`, which wraps the robot in a single
`wrappers.ExposeAsA2A(...)` call.

How AIP traffic flows:

```
AIP client → AIP gateway (/robots/<robot_id>/…) → Fabric proxy (ws) → tunnel
           → AIP handler → Zenoh topic robot/tunnel/action → bridge → /cmd_vel
```

The tunnel serves the A2A contract endpoints (`/.well-known/agent-card.json`,
`/invoke`, …) on any route not owned by the paid-action API, and the gateway
proxies them to the robot verbatim.

### Configuration

Copy the example env file and fill in your credentials (the tunnel loads
`.env` from its working directory on start):

```bash
cp tunnel/.env.example tunnel/.env
```

| Variable             | Required | Description                                              |
|----------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `AIP_ENABLED`        | yes      | Set `true` to enable BitAgent/AIP registration           |
| `CHAIN`              | no       | Chain preset: `bsc-testnet`, `bsc-mainnet`, `base-sepolia` or `base-mainnet` — sets both the x402 payment network and the AIP registration chain |
| `UNIBASE_PROXY_AUTH` | no*      | Bearer token — your account is resolved from it (falls back to `PRIVY_TOKEN`) |
| `AIP_USER_ID`        | no*      | Token-less fallback: wallet address to register under    |
| `AIP_ENDPOINT`       | no       | AIP platform URL (default `https://api.aip.unibase.com`) |
| `GATEWAY_URL`        | no       | AIP gateway URL (default `https://gateway.aip.unibase.com`) |
| `AIP_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`| no       | Public gateway base (default `https://api.fabric.foundation/api/core`) |
| `AIP_AGENT_NAME`     | no       | Display name (default `Robot <robot_id>`)                |
| `AIP_LOCAL_PORT`     | no       | Local port the SDK binds (default `8000`)                |

\* When neither is set, the tunnel walks you through a one-time browser
authorization on first run — open the printed URL, approve with your wallet,
and paste the token back. It is cached in
`~/.config/unibase-aip-sdk/config.json` for subsequent runs:

```
=== Unibase Authorization ===
[1/3] Fetching authorization URL ...
[2/3] Open this URL in your browser and approve:

  https://auth.pay.unibase.com?code=<one-time-code>

[3/3] Paste your Authorization token below and press Enter:
```

Then start the tunnel as usual (`make run`). On success the log shows:

```
registering robot as AIP agent  robot_id=<id>  endpoint_url=…/robots/<id>
ws connected to proxy           robot_id=<id>
```

Actions received via AIP are published to the same Zenoh topic
(`robot/tunnel/action`) as paid x402 actions, so the bridge and robot-side
safety logic are identical for both paths.
